Number Sorter (Prime, Odd, Even)

Description

This Python program accepts a range of integers from the user, sorts them into three different groups (odd, even, and prime), and stores them in separate text files. The program also ensures that only valid integer inputs are accepted.

Features

Accepts an integer range as input (e.g., 101-500)

Classifies numbers into:

Odd numbers (saved in File_Odd.txt)

Even numbers (saved in File_Even.txt)

Prime numbers (saved in File_Prime.txt)

Handles invalid inputs gracefully

Displays the contents of the files after processing

Files

Prime,odd,even.py (Main script)

File_Even.txt (Stores even numbers)

File_Prime.txt (Stores prime numbers)
